Email Notifications

Main feature:

Allows players to send an email to the owner or whatever email provided

Note to whoever uses this plugin that both a sending and receiving email address must be provided (can be the same address)

Players themselves do not have access to email or password

This used to be published on the Bukkit plugin page but was taken down because Macs are annoying and keep generated ".DS" hidden files :(. I couldn't figure out how to delete them or remove them from the packaging process.

Bukkit version: bukkit-1.7.9-R0.3
