# Email Notifications

_(Make sure you read all of it)_

## Main feature:

* Allows players to send an email to the owner or whatever email provided.

## Note:
* This plugin requires that both a sending and receiving email address must be provided (can be the same address).
* I know **IT IS A VERY BAD IDEA TO KEEP PASSWORDS IN PLAIN TEXT, SO USE THIS WITH VERY VERY EXTREME CAUTION**. I used a separate email account and hardcoded the password into the code but even that is still a bad idea. Just saying: _Beware of the danger_.
* (Of course, players do not have direct access to the email or password.)

Also this uses the Java Mail API, so you need that. It is a dependency.
Also *it only works for Gmail.*

This used to be published on the official Bukkit plugin website but was taken down because Macs will generate the ".DS" hidden file. I couldn't figure out how to delete them or remove them from the packaging process at the time.

Well... now I do since I know the command line but it is too late.
