Email Notifications

Main feature:

Allows players to send an email to the owner or whatever email provided

Note to whoever uses this plugin that both a sending and receiving email address must be provided (can be the same address)

Players themselves do not have access to email or password

This used to be published on the Bukkit plugin page but was taken down because Macs are annoying and keep generated ".DS" hidden files :(. I couldn't figure out how to delete them or remove them from the packaging process.

Well now I do since I know the command line command for it but it is too late.

NOTE: IT IS A VERY BAD IDEA TO KEEP PASSWORDS IN PLAIN TEXT, SO USE THIS WITH VERY VERY EXTREME CAUTION. I used an account I couldn't care for and hardcoded the password into the code but even that is a bad idea still. Just saying I'm aware of the danger.

Bukkit version: bukkit-1.7.9-R0.3
